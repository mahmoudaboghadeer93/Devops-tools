# AWS Lambda Auto-Scaling Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps to set up auto-scaling for your AWS Lambda functions using Amazon EventBridge and Slack integration.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to create Lambda functions, EventBridge rules, and IAM roles.
- Slack workspace with permissions to create incoming webhooks and slash commands.

## Steps

1. **Create Lambda Functions**:
   - Create two Lambda functions, one for scaling up and one for scaling down.
   - You can use the provided example Lambda function code in Python as a starting point.

2. **Create Incoming Webhook in Slack**:
   - Go to your Slack workspace.
   - Navigate to the channel where you want to receive notifications.
   - Add an app for "Incoming Webhooks" and follow the prompts to create a new webhook.
   - Copy the webhook URL generated.

3. **Define Environment Variable**:
   - Define a `SLACK_WEBHOOK` environment variable in each Lambda function with the Slack webhook URL obtained in the previous step.

4. **Create EventBridge Rules**:
   - Go to the [Amazon EventBridge Rules](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/home) console.
   - Create two EventBridge rules, one for scaling up and one for scaling down.
   - Use a cron expression to trigger the rules at the desired schedule.
   - Configure the rules to trigger the respective Lambda functions.

5. **Create Lambda Function URL**:
   - Expose your Lambda functions to be triggered from outside AWS.
   - You can use AWS API Gateway or other methods to create URLs for invoking the Lambda functions.

6. **Create Slack Slash Command**:
   - Create a Slack slash command to trigger the Lambda function.
   - Configure the slash command to send a request to the Lambda function URL created in the previous step.

## Additional Notes

- Test your Lambda functions and EventBridge rules to ensure they work as expected.
- Adjust the code and configurations based on your specific requirements and environment.
