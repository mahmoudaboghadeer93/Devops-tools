# Actions Runner Controller (ARC) (Github APP with Pull driven)

- I'm using pull driven (not webhook driven) autoscaling, because the k8s cluster in not externally accessible and webhook can‚Äôt be used, no public endpoint.

GitHub Actions automates the deployment of code to different environments, including production. The environments contain the `GitHub Runner` software which executes the automation. `GitHub Runner` can be run in GitHub-hosted cloud or self-hosted environments. Self-hosted environments offer more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools. They can be run on physical machines, virtual machines, or in a container. Containerized environments are lightweight, loosely coupled, highly efficient and can be managed centrally. However, they are not straightforward to use.

`Actions Runner Controller (ARC)` makes it simpler to run self hosted environments on Kubernetes(K8s) cluster.

With ARC you can :

- **Deploy self hosted runners on Kubernetes cluster** with a simple set of commands.
- **Auto scale runners** based on demand.
- **Setup across GitHub Enterprise editions**.

## Overview

For an overview of ARC, please refer to "[ARC Overview](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/Actions-Runner-Controller-Overview.md)."



## Getting Started

ARC can be setup with just a few steps.

In this section we will setup prerequisites, deploy ARC into a K8s cluster, and then run GitHub Action workflows on that cluster.

### Prerequisites


:one: Install cert-manager in your cluster. For more information, see "[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/)."

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

<sub> *note:- This command uses v1.9.1. Please replace with a later version, if available.</sub>

>You may also install cert-manager using Helm. For instructions, see "[Installing with Helm](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/#installing-with-helm)."

2Ô∏è‚É£ Build docker image that will be used on Runner Deployment using this customized Dockerfile:

```shell
FROM summerwind/actions-runner:latest
RUN sudo apt update -y \
  && sudo apt install ${Package_Name} \
  && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
````

3Ô∏è‚É£ Next, Create a Github App for ARC to authenticate with GitHub.

- Login to your GitHub account and follow steps "[Here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app)."

**Required Permissions for Repository Runners:**
**Repository Permissions**

- Actions (**read**)
- Administration (**read** / **write**)
- Metadata (**read**)
- Checks (**read**) (if you are going to use Webhook Driven Scaling)

**Required Permissions for Organization Runners:**

**Repository Permissions**

- Actions (**read**)
- Administration (**read** / **write**)
- Metadata (**read**)

***Organization Permissions***

- Self-hosted runners (**read** / **write**)

**Create GitHub Apps on your organization(as our case)**
You will see an App ID on the page of the GitHub App you created as follows, the value of this App ID will be used later.

Download the private key file by pushing the "Generate a private key" button at the bottom of the GitHub App page. This file will also be used later.

<img width="749" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69244659/195359460-27f9ab53-9dcb-4f9d-bc24-3359c737593c.png">

Go to the "Install App" tab on the left side of the page and install the GitHub App that you created for your account or organization.

When the installation is complete, you will be taken to a URL in one of the following formats, the last number of the URL will be used as the Installation ID later (For example, if the URL ends in settings/installations/8775, then the Installation ID is 8775).

### Deploy and Configure ARC

1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy  and configure ARC components on your K8s cluster. we use official Helm Chart with some customization for GHE.

##### Create namespace actions-runner-system for ARC:

```shell
kubectl create ns actions-runner-system
````
   
##### Configure GitHub App as K8s secret that will be used by ARC Deployments:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic controller-manager \
    -n actions-runner-system \
    --from-literal=github_app_id=${APP_ID} \
    --from-literal=github_app_installation_id=${INSTALLATION_ID} \
    --from-file=github_app_private_key=${PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PATH}
````
  
##### Add repository

```shell
helm repo add actions-runner-controller https://actions-runner-controller.github.io/actions-runner-controller
```

##### Install Helm chart

```shell
helm upgrade --install --namespace actions-runner-system \
             --set=githubEnterpriseServerURL=${GHE_URL}\
             --set=runnerGithubURL=${GHE_URL}\
             --set=githubURL="${GHE_API}"\
             --set=githubUploadURL="${GHE_API}"\
             --wait actions-runner-controller actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller
```


2Ô∏è‚É£ Create the GitHub self hosted runners deployment, HPA and configure to run against your organization.

Create a `runnerdeployment.yaml` file and copy the following YAML contents into it:

```yaml
apiVersion: actions.summerwind.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RunnerDeployment
metadata:
  name: ${runner_deployment_name}
  namespace: ${Namespace_name}
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      image: image_name_you_build_it_using_customized_Dockerfile
      dockerdWithinRunnerContainer: true     
      organization: ${Org_Name}
      labels:
       - ${label_name}
      group: ${group_name}
---
apiVersion: actions.summerwind.dev/v1alpha1
kind: HorizontalRunnerAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: runner-deployment-autoscaler
  namespace: ${Namespace_name}
spec:
spec:
  maxReplicas: 15
  metrics:
    - repositoryNames:
        - repo_name
      type: TotalNumberOfQueuedAndInProgressWorkflowRuns
  minReplicas: 1
  scaleDownDelaySecondsAfterScaleOut: 120
  scaleTargetRef:
    kind: RunnerDeployment
    name: arc-runner-deployment
````
Apply this file to your K8s cluster.
```shell
kubectl apply -f runnerdeployment.yaml
````

*üéâ We are done - now we should have self hosted runners running in K8s configured to your organization.  üéâ*

Next - lets verify our setup and execute some workflows.

### Verify and Execute Workflows

:one: Verify that your setup is successful:
```shell

$ kubectl get runners
NAME                             REPOSITORY                             STATUS
runner-deployment-test-2475h595fr   mumoshu/actions-runner-controller-ci   Running

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
runner-deployment-test-2475ht2qbr 2/2     Running   0          1m
````

Also, this runner has been registered directly to the organization, you can see it in organization settings. For more information, see "[Checking the status of a self-hosted runner - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-self-hosted-runners#checking-the-status-of-a-self-hosted-runner)."

:two: You are ready to execute workflows against this self-hosted runner. For more information, see "[Using self-hosted runners in a workflow - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow#using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow)."

There is also a quick start guide to get started on Actions, For more information, please refer to "[Quick start Guide to GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart)."
